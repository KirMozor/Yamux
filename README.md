# Yamux
Description: This is a client for Yandex Music on Unix

### Install dependencies

For the program to work correctly, you need a token from YandexMusic, instructions for obtaining it can be found here: https://yandex.ru/dev/direct/doc/start/index.html

`pip install PyQt5 toml mpv yandex_music`

You also need to install the package python-pyqt5 or python3-pyqt5
In ArchLinux I do it like this:

`sudo pacman -S python-pyqt5`

Tell me how to install this package on other systems, I will add it to the README.md

### Launch

You need to run the main.py file at the root of the program

`python3 main.py`
