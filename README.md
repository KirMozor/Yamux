# Yamux
Description: This is a client for Yandex Music on Unix

### Install dependencies

My program requires a token from YandexMusic, to get it, run the authorization program using the command `python3 authorize.py`
Dalle follow the instructions below

`pip install -U -r reqs.txt`

Also you need to get libmpv.so. It contains in packages `libmpv1`, `mpv-devels` and `mpv-libs`, so install one of them.

Sometimes you need to install the package python-pyqt5 or python3-pyqt5
In ArchLinux I do it like this:

`sudo pacman -S python-pyqt5`

In systems, which using apt, you can install it with this command:

`sudo apt install python3-pyqt5`


### Launch

You need to run the main.py file at the root of the program

`python3 main.py`

### By the way

There you can contact me as soon as possible.
