# Yamux
Description: This is a client for Yandex Music on Unix

### Install dependencies

My program requires a token from YandexMusic, to get it, follow this link: https://oauth.yandex.ru/authorize?response_type=token&client_id=ef4bf3db195c43739906b13dd7325e3f
Then run the program and follow the instructions

`pip install PyQt5 toml mpv yandex_music`

You also need to install the package python-pyqt5 or python3-pyqt5
In ArchLinux I do it like this:

`sudo pacman -S python-pyqt5`

Tell me how to install this package on other systems, I will add it to the README.md

### Launch

You need to run the main.py file at the root of the program

`python3 main.py`

### By the way

I have my own Telegram blog, where I talk about the progress and progress of development
There you can contact me as soon as possible.
