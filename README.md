# Yamux
Description: This is a client for Yandex Music on Unix

### Install dependencies

My program requires a token from YandexMusic, to get it, run the authorization program using the command `python3 authorize.py`
. Dalle follow the instructions below

`pip install -U -r reqs.txt`

Install VLC, how to install, look on the Internet for a manual specifically for your distribution. In Arch Linux, this is done like this:

`sudo pacman -S vlc`

Sometimes you need to install the package python-pyqt5 or python3-pyqt5
In ArchLinux I do it like this:

`sudo pacman -S python-pyqt5`

In systems, which using apt, you can install it with this command:

`sudo apt install python3-pyqt5`


### Launch
